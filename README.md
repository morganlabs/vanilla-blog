# Vanilla HTML Blog

This is a simple HTML blog built with Vanilla HTML, CSS and JS, and a
Webserver/API written in Go.

## Why?

I've faced bad burnout multiple times when it comes to software development.
It's what I want to do as a job, but I feel kinda useless when it comes to
things like fundamental concepts, especially in Javascript, so I'm challenging
myself to build this simple project to re-learn the Javascript, HTML and CSS
fundamentals, and get in some Rust, too.

This is part 1 of 4 in my plan. Learning to pace myself to avoid burnout,
learn the fundamentals, and figure out where my interests really lie.
